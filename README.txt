The plugin allows you to create as many blog entries as you want with random titles and text. In addition, you can indicate the category and the featured image.

== Description ==
The plugin allows you to create as many blog entries as you want. It has two modes. 

In the first mode it allows you to specify the title and text for the posts. 

In the second mode, neither title nor text is required. A \"Lorem Ipsum\" text is randomly generated according to the number of paragraphs you specify. In addition, you can configure whether you want headings, styles, lists, quotes, etc.

In both cases you can indicate how many posts you are going to create, add the featured image and the category of the post. In case the category does not exist previously, it is created automatically.
